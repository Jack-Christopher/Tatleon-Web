## How to contribute to Tatleon Web

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Open up a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/Jack-Christopher/Tatleon-Web/issues).**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Jack-Christopher/Tatleon-Web/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Jack-Christopher/Tatleon-Web/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Tatleon Web](http://www.tatleon.ultihost.net/contributing) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Tatleon Web will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](http://www.tatleon.ultihost.net/contributing/considerations)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change [here](mailto:tatleonweb@gmail.com).

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have goten positive answer about the change then start writing code. This is to avoid unnecessary work and to avoid the situation where a feature is being implemented but never accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Tatleon Web by sending an email [here](mailto:tatleonweb@gmail.com).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Please read [Contributing to the Tatleon Web Documentation](http://www.tatleon.ultihost.net/contributing/documentation).
